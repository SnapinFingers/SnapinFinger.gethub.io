            <P>
              Todd is a one of a kind personal manager, which uses top of the line software and artificial intelligence (AI) programing to accurately predict the best choice for the costumer to make. The AI, Todd, can also be used to aid the costumer(s) in everyday tasks which may seem difficult in a variety of environments, such as school and business. This highly intelligentand adaptable managing system takes the shape of a terminal, which can be accessed at any time with a key card specifically designated for the product. Todd is designed to benefit businesses and schools alike. Todd.Edu (the educational version of Todd) can be used to help students create a plan for their future career choices, create or change their schedule, to help to schedule time for extra help if the student needs, and much more. The terminal can also help students learn to work on things such as study habits, and encourage or remind students to do homework  through an engaging  mobile app.
             <br><br>
            For the business aspect of Todd (Todd.Biz) could be installed at a bank and work as a virtual financial advisor or accountant. Todd could help people manage their money and invest, plan for the future, or even help customers pay their bills or taxes. Due to the length of time and work required to complete these tasks, many people have trouble finding the space in their busy schedule to do them. This causes many people to be unprepared for their financial future. With Todd, members of the bank would be able to scan a card, allowing the AI to access your monetary files. With this, Todd would immediately know how to help you in the future with its powerful processing power paired with artificial intelligence, allowing people to prepare for their future in five quick minutes.</p>

            <li>Even though our product will be heavily encrypted, there is still a small risk of the software being hacked, putting any personal data at risk to said virtual intruder.<br><br>
            <li>Due to the high energy pull of an Artificial Intelligence sytsem, there is a minute chance that a circuit may overload; An overload of said circuit can also cause damage to the internal computing system.<br><br>
            <li>AI Terminal must be kept at a constant internal tempurature within a range of 67 and 77 to maintain optimium performance and avoid malfunctions which could affect both the hardware and the user.<br><br>
